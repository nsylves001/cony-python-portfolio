This assignment was fair. I had trouble doing the assignment especially question 4. Question 4 was asking for the overall proportion of percent_women,percent_child, and percent_men. I had to figure out if I should do all three columns at once or do each column indivually. I looked at Melanie Walsh's Panda Basics and I sat there and read each section closely. I realized that I usually don't know how to do the activites because I don't read closely. Reading closely really helped me move along and I breeze dthrough the assignment after queestion 4. Having the ability to complete an assignment by myself with no help gave me a great feeling. I only say this because in class when I was following along, I wasn't completely understanding what was happening and I didnt want to ask questions and waste class time. All in all, I had my struggles, but I am proud of the work i have done. Thank you for teaching a great class. I learned a lot.
